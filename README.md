## Project Introduction

#### This demo collection project was created in my spare time and includes some CSS and SVG effects, such as neon-style text buttons and cyberpunk-style text button images. It also includes an m3u8 player for streaming and playing videos, as well as several 360-degree panoramic views and some VR pages. Additionally, I have implemented a simple VR viewing effect (which can be viewed on mobile devices) and some basic Cesium operations. In the future, I plan to add some big data dashboards, but I'm not sure what else yet. If you find it helpful, please feel free to **star** it.
